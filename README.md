# spectralDensity
This project has python scripts for calculating amplitude spectral density and analysing other data in our experiment.
The entire project can be run from main.py which imports the functionality of the other files viz. spectral_density.py, transmission.py and temperature.py. If needed, the individual files can be run directly as well by calling the functions within the files themselves.
